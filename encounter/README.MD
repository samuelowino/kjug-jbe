## Encounter Service

A medical encounter is a documented, time-specific interaction between a patient and a healthcare provider, such as an office visit, telephone consultation, or inpatient stay.
It acts as the central point for capturing clinical data—including diagnoses, procedures, and orders—which is essential for patient care, documentation, and billing.
